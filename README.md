# Band Website ðŸŽ¸
Welcome to my first website! Here, youâ€™ll find a traditional band website reimagined for a fictional band from the novel [*Daisy Jones & The Six*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six) by [Taylor Jenkins Reid](https://taylorjenkinsreid.com).

This project marks my foray into web development. Access the website [**HERE**](https://vvhawk.github.io/band-website/index.html)

*With everything I create, I strive to give it a pretty face. Design is essential to me. The basis for this design was to capture the vintage 70s aesthetic of the book and envoke the feeling of watching a sunset in Los Angeles.*
