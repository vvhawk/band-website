# Band Website
Welcome to my first website! Here, youâ€™ll find a traditional band website reimagined for a fictional band from the novel [*Daisy Jones & The Six*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six), by [Taylor Jenkins Reid](https://taylorjenkinsreid.com).

This project marks my forray into web development. Access the website [**HERE**](https://vvhawk.github.io/band-website/index.html)

With everything I create, I strive to make it pretty to look at. Design is essential to me. The basis for my design was to capture the vintage 70s aesthetic of the book, and envoque the feeling of watching a sunset in Los Angelas.
